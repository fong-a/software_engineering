Pseudocode for the Hangman game:

Initialize the word to be guessed.
Initialize an empty list to store the letters that have been guessed.
Initialize the number of attempts the player has to guess the word.

Start a loop that continues until the player has no more attempts:
  Display the current state of the word, showing underscores for letters that have not been guessed and the actual letters for those that have been guessed.
  Ask the player for a letter guess.
  If the guessed letter is in the word:
    Add the guessed letter to the list of guessed letters.
  If the guessed letter is not in the word:
    Decrease the number of attempts by one.
    Display a message telling the player that the guess was incorrect and showing the number of remaining attempts.
  If all the letters in the word have been guessed:
    Display a message congratulating the player for guessing the word.
    End the game.
  If the loop ends because the player has no more attempts:
    Display a message telling the player that they have lost the game and showing the word that they were trying to guess.
